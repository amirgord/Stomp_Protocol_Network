updates:


1. parser new function: build string of map

    TODO
    2.1 place events json file in the right place and try to send
    2.2 make sure parse build properly
    2.3 make sure server get the message
    2.4 check if buffer big enough


3. user new function: send 
    
    TODO
    3.1 make sure send works

4. handle summery: user.summarizeGame(),Game.summarizeGame()

    TODO
    4.1 make sure summarizeGame works
    4.2 i think the best way is to change the events in game into vector<events>
    would be much elegant but need some work 
    it's needed becouse summery must be done according to the user how posted them
    i used D.S solution, added to the events in game (vector<vector<string>>) another slot user
    to save when reciving massage
    4.3 user build full path - TODO
    4.4 in game - maybe write directly to the file is more efficient

5. new function update game added and finished

    5.1 tests
